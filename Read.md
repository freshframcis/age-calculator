### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript for functionality
- media queries

### What I learned

I learned that different devices have varying view layouts, and to ensure the content displays correctly on each device, it is essential to use media queries. This allows the design to appear exactly as intended across all devices.

Additionally, I discovered that the Date object in JavaScript is more extensive than I initially thought. For example, months are zero-indexed, similar to arrays. Overall, every challenge I faced introduced valuable concepts worth learning.

### Continued development

I aim to significantly improve my JavaScript skills by taking on more projects that require its extensive use, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding. Through diverse projects, I hope to encounter various challenges and scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and creating dynamic web applications. Alongside practical projects, I will study JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts through tutorials, online courses, and documentation. Combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience will provide a comprehensive learning experience, helping me become proficient in JavaScript and supporting my growth as a front-end developer.
